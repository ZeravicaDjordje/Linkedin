Currently under Development

This is Aplication-Programing-Interface for Linkedin Social Media.
API is based on Selenium Automation System and few other librarys.
API provides next features:
- You can Login via Firefox or Chrome. Or in some cases if you want to stay anonimus via Tor(You have to install Tor and run it if you want this function to work)
- Send same or different message to all your connections(This is not provided by Linkedin you can send only one message per person)
- Connect with new people via your connection or via search engine(via search engine is currently under development). You can send 1000 proposals in 10 minutes. This is not recomended(500 proposal is optimal or if you want less it is also good)
- Virtual display is provided if you don't want to see browser running on your desktop
- Endorse all skills to your connections(The number of endorsed connections depends on you). Some of them will endorse you too, number depends on how much connections you endorsed.
- Visit peoples profile(They will see that their profile is visited, some of them will see your(Majority will check))
For now this is it. I will certanly add more features in future.
