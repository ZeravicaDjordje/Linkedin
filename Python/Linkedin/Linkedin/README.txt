Currently under Development
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is Library for Linkedin Social Media.
Library is based on Selenium Automation System and few other librarys.
Library provides next features:
- You can Login via Firefox or Chrome. Or in some cases if you want to stay anonimus via Tor(You have to install Tor and run it if you want this function to work)
- Send same or different message to all your connections(This is not provided by Linkedin you can send only one message per person)
- Connect with new people via your connection or via search engine(via search engine is currently under development). You can send 1000 proposals in 10 minutes. This is not recomended(500 proposal is optimal or if you want less it is also good)
- Virtual display is provided if you don't want to see browser running on your desktop
- Endorse all skills to your connections(The number of endorsed connections depends on you). Some of them will endorse you too, number depends on how much connections you endorsed.
- Visit peoples profile(They will see that their profile is visited, some of them will see your(Majority will check))
- You can make simple sql_lite database to keep track what connections you add or remove from database file.
- There is also skrol file that allows you to sroll to bottom, top or any other position on page.
For now this is it. I will certanly add more features in future.
Files that make up Library are.
1. linkedin.py
2. tor_ip.py(optional)
3. skrol.py
4. sql_linkedin.py(To make evidence who you Endorse and visit in your network)
